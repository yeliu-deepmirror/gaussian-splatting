Abstract: *Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.*


## Optimizer

See [the raw repo](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) for more instructions.
The optimizer uses PyTorch and CUDA extensions in a Python environment to produce trained models.

### Setup

#### Local Setup

create and run docker environment:
```shell
bash artifacts/docker/create_docker_image.sh
bash artifacts/docker/create_docker_container.sh
bash artifacts/docker/execute_docker_container.sh
```

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```

### Running

convert colmap built data session:
```shell
SESSION_NAME=VID_20230602_085920_00_011_office5
python convert.py -s ./Data/${SESSION_NAME}/colmap --skip_matching
```

To run the optimizer, simply use :
```shell
python train.py --source_path ./Data/${SESSION_NAME}/colmap --resolution 8 --iterations 60_000
```

for general outdoor scenes :
```shell
python train.py --source_path ./Data/${SESSION_NAME}/colmap --resolution 8 --iterations 60_000 \
--position_lr_init 0.000016 --scaling_lr 0.001
```

<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for train.py</span></summary>

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --model_path / -m
  Path where the trained model should be stored (```output/<random>``` by default).
  #### --images / -i

For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. **If not set and input image width exceeds 1.6K pixels, inputs are automatically rescaled to this target.**
  #### --data_device
  Specifies where to put the source image data, ```cuda``` by default, recommended to use ```cpu``` if training on large/high-resolution dataset, will reduce VRAM consumption, but slightly slow down training. Thanks to [HrsPythonix](https://github.com/HrsPythonix).
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --sh_degree

Note that similar to MipNeRF360, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. For convenience, arbitrary-size inputs can be passed and will be automatically resized if their width exceeds 1600 pixels. We recommend to keep this behavior, but you may force training to use your higher-resolution images by setting ```-r 1```.

The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/). You can find our SfM data sets for Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip). If you do not provide an output model directory (```-m```), trained models are written to folders with randomized unique names inside the ```output``` directory. At this point, the trained models may be viewed with the real-time viewer (see further below).

## Interactive Viewers
We provide two interactive viewers for our method: remote and real-time. Our viewing solutions are based on the [SIBR](https://sibr.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) framework, developed by the GRAPHDECO group for several novel-view synthesis projects.

#### build from source in Ubuntu 20.04
Backwards compatibility with Focal Fossa is not fully tested, but building SIBR with CMake should still work after invoking
```shell
# Dependencies
sudo apt install -y libglew-dev libassimp-dev libboost-all-dev libgtk-3-dev libglfw3-dev libavdevice-dev libavcodec-dev libeigen3-dev libxxf86vm-dev libembree-dev
sudo bash ./artifacts/docker/installers/opencv.sh
# Project setup
cd SIBR_viewers
git checkout fossa_compatibility
/gaussian-splatting/cmake/cmake-3.27.4-linux-x86_64/bin/cmake -Bbuild . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # add -G Ninja to build faster
/gaussian-splatting/cmake/cmake-3.27.4-linux-x86_64/bin/cmake --build build -j8 --target install
```

### Navigation in SIBR Viewers
The SIBR interface provides several methods of navigating the scene. By default, you will be started with an FPS navigator, which you can control with ```W, A, S, D, Q, E``` for camera translation and ```I, K, J, L, U, O``` for rotation. Alternatively, you may want to use a Trackball-style navigator (select from the floating menu). You can also snap to a camera from the data set with the ```Snap to``` button or find the closest camera with ```Snap to closest```. The floating menues also allow you to change the navigation speed. You can use the ```Scaling Modifier``` to control the size of the displayed Gaussians, or show the initial point cloud.

### Running the Real-Time Viewer

After extracting or installing the viewers, you may run the compiled ```SIBR_gaussianViewer_app[_config]``` app in ```<SIBR install dir>/bin```, e.g.:
```shell
TRAIN_ID=2fbbfa1f-1
/gaussian-splatting/SIBR_viewers/install/bin/SIBR_gaussianViewer_app \
-m /gaussian-splatting/output/${TRAIN_ID}
```

https://github.com/yeliu-deepmirror/gaussian-splatting/assets/74998488/cae483ec-e89c-418e-94f1-e8988f016fbd

https://github.com/yeliu-deepmirror/gaussian-splatting/assets/74998488/42c3a9d5-4476-4703-8b4c-c26ce74fd7a6

It should suffice to provide the ```-m``` parameter pointing to a trained model directory. Alternatively, you can specify an override location for training input data using ```-s```. To use a specific resolution other than the auto-chosen one, specify ```--rendering-size <width> <height>```. Combine it with ```--force-aspect-ratio``` if you want the exact resolution and don't mind image distortion.

**To unlock the full frame rate, please disable V-Sync on your machine and also in the application (Menu &rarr; Display). In a multi-GPU system (e.g., laptop) your OpenGL/Display GPU should be the same as your CUDA GPU (e.g., by setting the application's GPU preference on Windows, see below) for maximum performance.**

<!-- ![Teaser image](assets/select.png) -->

In addition to the initial point cloud and the splats, you also have the option to visualize the Gaussians by rendering them as ellipsoids from the floating menu.
SIBR has many other functionalities, please see the [documentation](https://sibr.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) for more details on the viewer, navigation options etc. There is also a Top View (available from the menu) that shows the placement of the input cameras and the original SfM point cloud; please note that Top View slows rendering when enabled. The real-time viewer also uses slightly more aggressive, fast culling, which can be toggled in the floating menu. If you ever encounter an issue that can be solved by turning fast culling off, please let us know.

  #### --iteration
  Specifies which of state to load if multiple are available. Defaults to latest available iteration.
  #### --path / -s
  Argument to override model's path to source dataset.
  #### --rendering-size

  #### --load_images
  Flag to load source dataset images to be displayed in the top view for each camera.
  #### --device
  Index of CUDA device to use for rasterization if multiple are available, ```0``` by default.
  #### --no_interop
